The contrast is reflected in the liquid, marrying Pedro Ximenez sweetness, virgin charred oak spice and a high proportion of ex-bourbon casks giving an intense hallmark Ardbeg flavour.Bottled at 46.6% abv without chill filtration, the nose is subtly smoky with creamy toffee and aniseed atop fruity peach and banana notes. The palate is smooth and creamy with orange chocolate, treacle, smoky tea leaves and sweet spices. Gentle aniseed and hickory linger with subtle smoke on the finish.`,

It was firstly matured in refill American oak casks before it was treated to a finish in first fill European oak Oloroso sherry butts for an additional nine months. The expression was launched in 1993, and has become a somewhat iconic whisky over the years. Even at 12 years old, this rich and complex dram is an excellent example of what the Balvenie distillery can craft.`,

A bomb crater from World War II behind the distillery now forms the pond which supplies cooling water to the condensers. Production resumed after the war in 1948 but every litre of whisky made went into blended Scotch – Auchentoshan was reputed to lend a smoothness and a ‘brandy-like character’ to the mix. Only in the 1970s was it first bottled by its owner as a single malt, but now there is a core range of six expressions, including this 18 Years Old.'`,

Taking influence from the bourbon cask that it was matured in, the whisky is light in colour and sweet on the nose with hints of toffee and vanilla swirling through the glass. The palate is strong with alcohol at first but quickly mellows into a sweet flavour of soft honey and melting toffee that passes and gives way to a refreshing burst of citrus fruits. The finish continues the sweet theme with strong notes of barley sugar that bring the complexity of this malt to a warm but fresh finally `,
